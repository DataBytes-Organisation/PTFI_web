# Privacy Technology Project (PTFI)_web  
 Web development for Privacy Technology Project (PTFI)  

This is a simple academic paper website project, similar to IEEE, built using the React framework and Node.js. The goal of this project is to provide a platform where users can register, log in, and view basic information on the homepage.  

## Prerequisites  

Before you begin, ensure you have installed the following on your development environment:  

- Node.js (latest stable version recommended)  
- npm (usually installed with Node.js)  
- Git  

## Installation Steps  

### Clone the Repository  

First, clone the project to your local machine:  

```bash  
git clone  
  
### Install Backend Dependencies  
Navigate to the project root directory and install the required backend dependencies:  
cd Privacy-Technology-Project--PTFI-_web  
npm install
  
### Install Frontend Dependencies  
The project uses React for the frontend, so you need to install related dependencies. Navigate to the client folder and run the npm install command:
  
cd client  
npm install
  
### Start the Project  
Start the Backend Server  
From the project root directory, use the following command to start the backend server:  
node server.js  
Start the React Development Server  
Open a new terminal window, make sure you are still in the client folder, then use the following command to start the frontend development server:
npm start
This will automatically open a new tab in your default browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to display the frontend interface of the project.

##Feature Overview  
The current version of the project supports the following features:  

Communication between a local server and the client
