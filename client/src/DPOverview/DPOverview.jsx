        <h2 className="heading">Introduction to Differential Privacy</h2>
        <p className="text">
            This page introduces the concept of Differential Privacy, how it works, and why it’s crucial for protecting sensitive information in the financial sector. You’ll learn about its benefits, how it can be implemented, and real-world applications, making it a valuable tool for financial institutions aiming to balance data privacy with meaningful analysis.
        </p>

        <h2 className="heading">What is Differential Privacy (DP)?</h2>
        <p className="text">
        Definition: Differential Privacy is a privacy technique that ensures adding or removing a single data point (e.g., a person’s information) in a dataset doesn't significantly change the outcome of the analysis. This ensures the privacy of individual data within the dataset.
By adding random noise to the data, DP allows organizations to extract insights without revealing personal information, making it vital for industries like finance, where maintaining privacy is essential.
        </p>

        <h3 className="subheading">How Differential Privacy Works</h3>
        <p className="text">
            Differential Privacy works by adding noise to data before processing. This ensures the data remains anonymous while allowing accurate analysis.
        </p>
        <ul className="list">
            <li>Step 1: Data is collected from sources, such as customer transactions.</li>
            <li>Step 2: Random noise is added to mask individual records while keeping patterns intact.</li>
            <li>Step 3: Data is analysed, providing insights without exposing personal information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text">
            This method protects personal data while still allowing financial institutions to make important decisions.
